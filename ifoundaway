Well, I never thought that it'd be so simple but
I found a way, I found a way
And I always thought that it'd be too crazy but
I found a way, I found a way
If you open up your mind
See what's inside
It's gonna take some time to realign
But if you look inside, I'm sure you'll find
Over your shoulder you know that I told you
I'll always be pickin' you up when you're down
So just turn around
Now that I know that anything's possible
I found a way, I found a way
No one can break what's so unbreakable
I found a way, I found a way
