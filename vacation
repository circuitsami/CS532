Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then
You should go and change it
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every singe day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay
Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, I love it, on the daily
You say you hate your job but you'll never leave, never leave
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
My brother called me up, said he saw me on TV
I said it wasn't easy but right now I'm living breezy
Built this engine from the ground up
Now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me?
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay
Illuminate, my future bright, so thankful for everything
Rejuvenating my inner light as I work hard for all I need
Open arms, embracing life and all of which you gave to me
Hard work it pays off, I'm happy now, it's paying me
Close my eyes, sometimes it feels as if I float away
I love the life I live, enjoy the ride along the way
I make a living out of living, yeah, that's what I say
I got one life to live and I wouldn't live it no other way
